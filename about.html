			<h3>John Doe</h3>
			<p>I have had over 10 years of experience as a professional photographer for various magazines, newspapers, and
				galleries across the Midwest United States. I am notable for being the favorite photographer for celebrities such
				as John Smith and Jane Doe. I am most known for his series of pictures titled <i>"The girl on fire"</i> which was
				featured in the New York Times in 2009. I like to focus on one-shot stories capturing the split-second moments that
				define entire experiences. I am skilled with the use of image editing software such as Adobe Photoshop and Creative
				Suite. I am famous in the photo retouching arena for my skill of highlighting sepia tones while maintaining a
				strict balance between all other color spectra, thus highlighting skin glow.</p>

			<p>I have graduated with a Bachelor of Art in Art and Photography from the University of Harvard. While attending
				college, I also served as a freelance photographer in the area surrounding the school. My pictures were picked up
				by the Massachusetts city newspaper, and I soon rose to become head photographer for the newspaper. Afterwards, I
				took a contract with Rose magazine and started capturing heated moments at various dancing shows. My picture of the
				<i>Black Swan</i> of 2007 still resides in the Rose Hall of Fame. I have also traveled internationally, and my
				images of highland steppes of Malaysia have been published in AFAR magazine.</p>

			<p>Along with my passion of photography, I also am greatly involved with the community. I regularly travel accross
				the country capturing images of people that want me to take their pictures. Additionally, I have been greatly
				involved with raising awareness for malnuration and dehydration in third world countires. I have sponsored many
				educational activities for children, encouranging them to use their love for capturing moments through art to
				depict the word around them.</p>
